# Internship-2024


# This repo will serve as the project layout for Internship 2024

# Goal: Produce a ML algorithm (DNN, CNN, LLM, etc) from scratch containing all the neccesary different components, and documenting the entire process, links, and startups.

## Current - Facial Recognition using ML

Implement a generic ML algorithm that can infer from any vector dataset added to it, and use alignment models as necessary on the output to perform facial recognition.

Start with this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/) for facial reocognition.
