## Subject - Deepfake Generated Chatbot

The premise of this project will be to implement a realtime deepfake chatbot from scratch. This project will work in phases, first by implementing a generic ML algorithm that can infer from any vector dataset added to it, and use alignment models as necessary on the output. The second phase will be implementing APIs for openAI in order to build the real-time chatbot.
