# Internship-2024


# This repo will serve as the project layout for Internship 2024

# Goal: Produce a ML algorithm (DNN, CNN, LLM, etc) from scratch containing all the neccesary different components, and documenting the entire process, links, and startups.

## Current - Facial Recognition using ML

Implement a generic ML algorithm that can infer from any vector dataset added to it, and use alignment models as necessary on the output to perform facial recognition.

Start with this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/) for facial reocognition.


Changes needed:
- create a simple http digest server to intake the photo in a json put/post and return a json object with the data recognition returned
- detector needs to use either proper object oriented pass by reference, or use python pass by dict method (each call, and/or pass by reference needs to be clear so as know which data is being used)
- documentation of how much was manually scripted vs ai generated
- requirements.txt or setup.py
- documentation on methods used, process flow, and input/output black box description of functionality
- documentation on the license for the model (what would be best to forward computer science, a company, or personal use...), the data, and the result
- what license is the source code roots, and/or branches used?
- theoretical use cases each of the above categories taking all the considerations into account
- is this the best solution, what could be better, what is missing?
- stream line the execution of the workflow using a single command
