# Internship-2024


# This repo will serve as the project layout for Internship 2024

# Goal: Produce a ML algorithm (DNN, CNN, LLM, etc) from scratch containing all the neccesary different components, and documenting the entire process, links, and startups.

## Current - Facial Recognition using ML

Implement a generic ML algorithm that can infer from any vector dataset added to it, and use alignment models as necessary on the output to perform facial recognition.

Start with this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/) for facial reocognition.


Changes needed:
- create a simple http digest server to intake the photo in a json put/post and return a json object with the data recognition returned
- detector needs to use either proper object oreinted pass by reference, or use python pass by dict method (meaing each call, and pass by reference needs to be clear so as know if the data being used)
- documentation of how much was manually scripted vs ai generated
- requirements.txt or setup.py
- documentation on methods used, process flow, and input/output black box description of functionality
- documentation on the license for the model (what would be best to forward computer science, a company, or personal use...), the data, and the result
- what license is the source code roots, and/or braches used?
- theoretical use cases each of the above categories taking all the considerations into account
- is this the best solution, what could be better, what is missing?
- stream line the execution of the workflow using a single command
