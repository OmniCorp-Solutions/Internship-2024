## Subject - DNN Image Classifier Reworking Using CIFAR-100 Dataset

The premise of this project will be to utilize a neural network to accurately classify images from the [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) using SGD. 
The implementation will utilize Python as the major language of choice to differentiate from a [former project](https://github.com/bwcurless/CS453_DNN) involving the much more condensed CIFAR-10 dataset 
and usage of CUDA and C++. The focus will be to increase scale and use a different language to prove my understanding of DNN concepts.
